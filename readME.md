# Casino Games Project

Welcome to my Casino Games Project! This project is a demonstration of my problem-solving skills and proficiency in Java. I have developed a fully functional Blackjack game that runs directly in the terminal, and I am currently completing a Poker game with simulated players.

## Features

### âœ… **Blackjack Game**
- Fully functional and interactive terminal-based Blackjack.
- Follows standard Blackjack rules.
- Includes betting, hit, stand, and double-down mechanics.
- Designed with Object-Oriented Programming principles for clean and maintainable code.

### ðŸ”Ž **Poker Game (In Progress)**
- Near-complete Poker game with simulated players.
- Players will make random yet strategic decisions using probability and decision logic.
- Game features realistic poker rounds, including betting, folding, calling, and raising.
- A fair deck system ensures cards are removed as they are played.
- Dynamic game flow simulates the experience of playing at a real poker table.

## Goals
- Showcase my problem-solving abilities by developing complex game logic.
- Demonstrate proficiency in Java, with a focus on OOP concepts.
- Build simulations that provide an engaging and realistic player experience.

## Installation
To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/emsilver987/Casino.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Casino
    ```
3. Compile and run the Blackjack game:
    ```bash
    javac Main.java
    java Main
    ```

The Poker game will be available soon!

## Future Plans
- Complete and refine the Poker AI to make smarter decisions based on real poker strategies.
- Add additional casino games for a complete casino experience.
- Implement a graphical user interface for an enhanced gaming experience.
