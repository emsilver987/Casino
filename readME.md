Welcome to my **Casino Games Project** — a showcase of my Java development skills, object-oriented design, and problem-solving ability. This terminal-based application features two classic casino games: **Blackjack** and **Poker**, both designed with extensibility, clean code principles, and test-driven development (TDD) in mind.

## 🧠 Core Technologies & Principles

- **Java 17**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** with SOLID principles
- **Design Patterns** including *Chain of Responsibility* for poker hand evaluation
- **JUnit** for **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** with extensive test coverage
- **Modular Code Architecture** for maintainability and scalability

---

## ♠️ Features

### ✅ **Blackjack (Fully Functional)**
- Classic Blackjack with terminal interaction
- Implements standard rules: hit, stand, double down, and betting system
- Built using clean OOP design: player, dealer, and deck abstraction

### ♣️ **Poker (In Progress)**
- Simulated Texas Hold’em with 5 other players at the table
- Each simulated player makes strategic decisions based on randomization and probability
- Full game lifecycle: betting, calling, folding, raising, and showdown
- Evaluator logic built using the **Chain of Responsibility** pattern for modularity and clarity
- Deck and card management ensures card integrity and fairness
- Robust unit tests for hand evaluations and gameplay scenarios

---

## 🧪 Testing & TDD

All core logic is developed using **Test-Driven Development** with **JUnit 5**.  
Tests include:
- Blackjack game flow scenarios
- Poker hand evaluation (e.g., flushes, full houses, pairs)
- Deck shuffling and integrity
- Simulated player behavior

TDD helped significantly reduce debugging time and improve code reliability across complex logic paths.

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/emsilver987/Casino.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd Casino
   ```

3. Compile and run the game:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   java Main
   ```

The Poker game is playable but still under development — refinements coming soon!

---

## 🌱 Future Plans

- ✅ **Complete Poker logic and polish player AI**
- 🎨 **Add a graphical user interface (GUI)** to enhance user experience
- 🕹️ **Add more casino games** (e.g., Slots, Roulette, or Baccarat)
- 📊 **Improve player behavior models** using probability-based strategies or ML simulations
- 🌐 **Potential web deployment** using JavaScript or React for the front-end
